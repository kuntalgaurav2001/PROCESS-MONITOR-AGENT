# Process Monitoring System - Assumptions and Limitations

## Overview

This document outlines the key assumptions made during the development of the Process Monitoring System and the current limitations that users should be aware of. Understanding these constraints is essential for proper deployment and usage.

## Assumptions

### 1. System Environment

#### Operating System Support
- **Assumption**: The system will be deployed on modern operating systems (Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 18.04+)
- **Rationale**: These platforms have stable Python support and psutil compatibility
- **Impact**: Older operating systems may experience compatibility issues

#### Python Environment
- **Assumption**: Python 3.8+ is available on the target system
- **Rationale**: Modern Python features and security updates
- **Impact**: Python 3.7 and below are not supported

#### Network Connectivity
- **Assumption**: Agents can reach the backend server via HTTP/HTTPS
- **Rationale**: REST API communication requires network access
- **Impact**: Air-gapped systems require alternative deployment strategies

### 2. Security and Permissions

#### Process Access Rights
- **Assumption**: Agents run with sufficient privileges to read process information
- **Rationale**: System monitoring requires access to process details
- **Impact**: Limited permissions may result in incomplete data collection

#### API Key Security
- **Assumption**: API keys will be stored securely and not shared publicly
- **Rationale**: Simple authentication model for agent-backend communication
- **Impact**: Compromised keys allow unauthorized data submission

#### Network Security
- **Assumption**: Network infrastructure provides basic security (firewalls, etc.)
- **Rationale**: HTTP-based communication assumes network-level protection
- **Impact**: Unsecured networks may expose sensitive data

### 3. Data and Privacy

#### Process Information
- **Assumption**: Process names and metadata are not considered sensitive
- **Rationale**: System monitoring requires process identification
- **Impact**: Some organizations may have stricter privacy requirements

#### Data Retention
- **Assumption**: Historical data retention is acceptable for monitoring purposes
- **Rationale**: Trend analysis requires historical data
- **Impact**: Long-term storage may raise privacy concerns

#### Process Filtering
- **Assumption**: Configurable process filtering provides sufficient privacy protection
- **Rationale**: Users can exclude sensitive applications
- **Impact**: Manual configuration required for privacy compliance

### 4. Performance and Scalability

#### System Resources
- **Assumption**: Adequate CPU and memory resources are available
- **Rationale**: Process monitoring requires system resources
- **Impact**: Resource constraints may affect monitoring performance

#### Database Performance
- **Assumption**: SQLite provides sufficient performance for development and small deployments
- **Rationale**: Simple deployment and maintenance
- **Impact**: Large-scale deployments may require PostgreSQL/MySQL

#### Concurrent Users
- **Assumption**: Limited number of concurrent users accessing the frontend
- **Rationale**: Development-focused system
- **Impact**: High concurrent usage may require production-grade servers

### 5. User Experience

#### Technical Expertise
- **Assumption**: Users have basic technical knowledge for configuration
- **Rationale**: System administration requires technical skills
- **Impact**: Non-technical users may need additional support

#### Browser Compatibility
- **Assumption**: Modern web browsers with JavaScript support
- **Rationale**: Interactive frontend requires modern browser features
- **Impact**: Older browsers may have limited functionality

## Limitations

### 1. Technical Limitations

#### Real-time Updates
- **Limitation**: Updates are polling-based, not true real-time
- **Impact**: Data may be several seconds to minutes old
- **Workaround**: Reduce polling intervals (increases server load)

#### Database Constraints
- **Limitation**: SQLite has concurrent write limitations
- **Impact**: Multiple agents may experience write conflicts
- **Workaround**: Use PostgreSQL/MySQL for production deployments

#### Process Access
- **Limitation**: Some system processes may be inaccessible
- **Impact**: Incomplete process information
- **Workaround**: Run agent with elevated privileges (security consideration)

#### Platform Differences
- **Limitation**: Process information varies by operating system
- **Impact**: Inconsistent data across platforms
- **Workaround**: Platform-specific data normalization

### 2. Security Limitations

#### Authentication Model
- **Limitation**: Simple API key authentication
- **Impact**: Limited security features compared to enterprise solutions
- **Workaround**: Implement additional security layers (VPN, firewall rules)

#### Data Encryption
- **Limitation**: No built-in data encryption
- **Impact**: Sensitive data may be exposed in transit/storage
- **Workaround**: Use HTTPS and encrypted storage solutions

#### Access Control
- **Limitation**: No user role management
- **Impact**: All users have equal access to all data
- **Workaround**: Implement application-level access controls

### 3. Scalability Limitations

#### Single Server Architecture
- **Limitation**: Backend runs on single server
- **Impact**: Single point of failure, limited horizontal scaling
- **Workaround**: Load balancers and multiple backend instances

#### Database Scaling
- **Limitation**: SQLite doesn't support distributed deployments
- **Impact**: Limited scalability for large datasets
- **Workaround**: Migrate to distributed databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

#### Memory Constraints
- **Limitation**: All data loaded into memory for processing
- **Impact**: Large datasets may cause memory issues
- **Workaround**: Implement pagination and data streaming

### 4. Feature Limitations

#### Process Tree Depth
- **Limitation**: Process trees may become very deep
- **Impact**: UI may become unwieldy with complex hierarchies
- **Workaround**: Implement tree depth limits and lazy loading

#### Historical Data
- **Limitation**: Limited historical data analysis
- **Impact**: Basic trend analysis only
- **Workaround**: Implement data warehousing and analytics tools

#### Alerting System
- **Limitation**: No built-in alerting capabilities
- **Impact**: Manual monitoring required
- **Workaround**: Implement external monitoring and alerting systems

#### Multi-tenancy
- **Limitation**: Single-tenant architecture
- **Impact**: Cannot separate data by organization/user
- **Workaround**: Deploy separate instances per organization

### 5. Operational Limitations

#### Backup and Recovery
- **Limitation**: No automated backup system
- **Impact**: Data loss risk
- **Workaround**: Implement manual backup procedures

#### Monitoring and Logging
- **Limitation**: Basic logging without centralized management
- **Impact**: Difficult troubleshooting in distributed environments
- **Workaround**: Implement centralized logging (ELK stack, etc.)

#### Deployment Complexity
- **Limitation**: Manual deployment and configuration
- **Impact**: Time-consuming setup and maintenance
- **Workaround**: Use containerization and automation tools
